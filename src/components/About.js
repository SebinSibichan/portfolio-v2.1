        Hi, I'm Sebin, a passionate software engineer and design enthusiast. My
        journey into coding and design began unexpectedly during the second year
        of my Bachelor of Technology in ECE, which I completed in 2021. The
        pandemic-induced isolation opened a new world for me. With no prior
        experience in coding, I self-taught programming and design during that
        period and decided to pivot my career towards software engineering and
        design.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4">
        My first professional leap was joining a startup as a software engineer,
        where I delved into the software development process,developing skill in
        technologies like Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Azure. After a
        year of enriching experience, I ventured into the fulltime freelance
        world, working with agencies and eventually building my own client base.
        As a freelance developer, I’ve crafted software solutions tailored to
        various business needs using React, Next.js, Python, Strapi, and
        WordPress. In addition to my software expertise, I specialize in
        designing graphic arts and assets, leveraging tools like Photoshop and
        Illustrator to create compelling visuals that elevate digital
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p className="text-text-secondary mb-4">
        Driven by a deep interest in startups and entrepreneurship, I’m
        constantly exploring new opportunities to innovate and create impactful
        solutions. My recent work includes developing a learning management
        system for a training institute, now in its final stages. Beyond my
        professional endeavors, I find inspiration in traveling and exploring
        new places. As I continue to grow, I’m committed to advancing my skills
        in both technology and design, striving to deliver innovative and
        effective solutions.
